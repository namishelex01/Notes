# Exploits

Three ways to attack - Social, Physical, Network

## Social

    Ask the person for access, phishing.
    Cognitive biases - look at how these are exploited.
    Spear phishing.
    Water holing.
    Baiting (dropping CDs or USB drivers and hoping people use them).
    Tailgating.

## Physical

    Get hard drive access, will it be encrypted?
    Boot from linux.
    Brute force password.
    Keyloggers.
    Frequency jamming (bluetooth/wifi).
    Covert listening devices.
    Hidden cameras.
    Disk encryption.
    Trusted Platform Module.
    Spying via unintentional radio or electrical signals, sounds, and vibrations (TEMPEST - NSA).

## Network

    Nmap.
    Find CVEs for any services running.
    Interception attacks.
    Getting unsecured info over the network.

Exploit Kits and drive-by download attacks

Remote Control

    Remote code execution and privilege.
    Bind shell (opens port and waits for attacker).
    Reverse shell (connects to port on attackers C2 server).

Spoofing

    Email spoofing.
    IP address spoofing.
    MAC spoofing.
    Biometric spoofing.
    ARP spoofing.

Tools

    Metasploit.
    ExploitDB.
    Shodan - Google but for devices/servers connected to the internet.
    Google the version number of anything to look for exploits.
    Hak5 tools.
