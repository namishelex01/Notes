# Exploits

Three ways to attack - Social, Physical, Network

## Social

    Ask the person for access, phishing.
    Cognitive biases - look at how these are exploited.
    Spear phishing.
    Water holing - Attacker guesses or observes which websites an organization often uses and infects one or more of them with malware.
    Baiting (dropping CDs or USB drivers and hoping people use them).
    Tailgating.

## Physical

    Get hard drive access, will it be encrypted?
    Boot from linux.
    Brute force password.
    Keyloggers.
    Frequency jamming (bluetooth/wifi).
    Covert listening devices.
    Hidden cameras.
    Disk encryption.
    Trusted Platform Module.
    Spying via unintentional radio or electrical signals, sounds, and vibrations (TEMPEST - NSA).

## Network

    Nmap.
    Find CVEs for any services running.
    Interception attacks.
    Getting unsecured info over the network.

Exploit Kits

    Collection of exploits

Drive-by download attacks
    
    Unintentional download of malicious code onto a computer or mobile device 

Remote Control

    Remote code execution and privilege.
    Bind shell (opens port and waits for attacker).
    Reverse shell (connects to port on attackers C2 server).

Spoofing

    Email spoofing
        SPF - Sender policy framework (Create policy to define Email service)
        DMARC - Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (Added authentication method that uses both SPF and DKIM to verify)
        DKIM - DomainKeys Identified Mail (provides an encryption key and digital signature that verifies that an email message was not forged or altered)
    IP address spoofing
        Hop-count filtering
    MAC spoofing
    Biometric spoofing
    ARP spoofing
        Mitigation = Packet filtering

Tools

    Metasploit.
    ExploitDB.
    Shodan - Google but for devices/servers connected to the internet.
    Google the version number of anything to look for exploits.
    Hak5 tools.
