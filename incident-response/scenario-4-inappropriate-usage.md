| An inappropriate usage incident is any incident involving an internal employee or contractor violating a code of conduct or a computer policy. Inappropriate behaviour is not always malicious and targeted. Sometimes a user will simply act carelessly or even be completely unaware of the policy or code of conduct he has infringed. The inappropriate behaviour will sometimes constitute a serious security incident in itself, but it can also be the cause or trigger of a serious incident (like malware infection, loss of critical data) | Payment transactionsCredit card informationCustomer commercial and personal informationConfidential information in general | Weak management or control of confidential dataBad user password management Lack of segregation of duties, accumulation of access rights Lack of application security or monitoringLack of procedures or control to enforce policies and codes of conduct | Inform and get advice from Compliance and/or the legal departmentInactivate users or withdraw access rightsMake forensic copies of logs and other crucial information to trace and prove what happenedCheck logs and other information for traces of the infringement |
